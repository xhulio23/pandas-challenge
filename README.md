# pandas-challenge

I had a lot of fun doing this project. At first it felt overwhelming, but with the guidance and some of the input codes that were there already, it made this project much easier to complete. 

When opening the ipynb file, please download it first. 

I did get a few debugs in which after numerous of hours of trying, it was no luck. The error message was "% Passing Math, size_passing_math" column not found. 

To complete this project I used the codes learned in class and I also had to look at some youtube tutorials.
